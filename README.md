# otp.ex

Erlang/OTP transpiled to Elixir using [EFE (Elixir Flavoured Erlang)](https://github.com/marianoguerra/efe)

The objective of this repository is to allow Elixir programmers to read Erlang
code for projects they use, most of the code compiles but I can't ensure that
it behaves identically to the original source.

Use it for educational purposes or at your own risk.

projects, but not sure.
